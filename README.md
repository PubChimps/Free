# The Ultimate Free Machine Learning Development Stack
### 4 tools, 0 dollars, everything you'll need

## Introduction

I've spent the past 3 years help Data Scientists and Developers navigate the vast land  evaluate and utilize

## Object Storage 
Object storage is critcal to machine learning development, and provides a place to store training, test, and validation data sets as well as pretrained and fine-tuned models. It's also a huge revenue generator for cloud companies, as AWS' S3 is reported by numerous sources as the most popular service for the multi, multi billion dollar organization, so finding persistent and unlimited cloud object storage is quite difficult, but not impossible. 

Algorithmia is a serverless Machine Learning deployment platform (more on deploying models below). There are a number of utilites that Algorimthmia provides in order to facilitate the deployment of models, including free object storage. According to their docs, "Algorithmiaâ€™s Data Sources make it easy to host your data files on the Algorithmia platform for free, while our Data API makes it a cinch to work with your hosted data." Their Data API is available in Python and has a getFile()/putFile() structure that makes it easy to download and upload training/testing/validataion data sets as well as pretrained and fine-tuned models. Data collections can be made public, shared between teams, or private, and is free to store and access.

## Model Development and Training
There are a number of free, hosted Jupyter enviroments that can help in developing machine learning models. My favorite is Google Colab. Colab provides free access to GPUs, even including NVIDIA V100's if you are lucky, and has very tight and very easy to use integrations with both GitHub and Weights and Biases (more on Weights and Biases later). The free object storage service
