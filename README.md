# The Ultimate Free Machine Learning Development Stack
### 4 tools, 0 dollars, everything you'll need

## Introduction

## Object Storage 
Algorithmia is a serverless Machine Learning deployment platform (more on deploying models below). There are a number of utilites that Algorimthmia provides in order to facilitate the deployment of models, including free object storage. According to their docs, "Algorithmiaâ€™s Data Sources make it easy to host your data files on the Algorithmia platform for free, while our Data API makes it a cinch to work with your hosted data." Their Data API is available in Python and has a getFile()/putFile() structure that makes it easy to download and upload training/testing/validataion data sets as well as pretrained and fine-tuned models. Data collections can be made public, shared between teams, or private, and is free to store and access.

## Model Development and Training
There are a number of free, hosted Jupyter enviroments that can help in developing machine learning models. My favorite is Google Colab.
